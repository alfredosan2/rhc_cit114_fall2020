#Notes 07: Storage
### 1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos 
+ I liked how it explained in depth the most common levels used by businesses for backups are RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 6 and RAID 1+0. Also, how RAIDS are often used with SANS and NAS systems. How volatile vs non-volatile memory cannot and can retain data.

### 2. Identify two quotes that were made, that you found interesting.
1. "Software test and development environments often require separate, independent, and duplicate storage environments to be built out, managed, and decommissioned. In addition to the time required, the up-front capital costs required can be extensive." (9.04). <br/>
2. "When development teams are ready to execute, infrastructure should never slow them down. Cloud storage allows IT to quickly deliver the exact amount of storage needed, right when it's needed. This allows IT to focus on solving complex application problems instead of having to manage storage systems." (9.03). <br/>

### 3. What new facts did you learn from this section?
+ Some of the largest and most valuable companies in the world have created applications in record time by leveraging the flexibility, performance, and low cost of cloud storage. Even the simplest static websites can be improved for an amazingly low cost.
+ Fault tolerance is the idea that a system can continue to run properly even in the event of a failure of a component of that system.
+ Disaster recovery (DR) starts with a plan that works in conjunction with the business continuity and contingency plans. In DR, the goal is to get a business back operating as normally as possible as quickly as possible.
+ If a computer does not have the recommended memory to run the operating system and software programs being used, it will result in slower performance. The more memory a computer has, the more information and software it can load and process quickly.

### 4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
1. Does Intelâ€™s Optane memory count as nonvolatile memory even though it is used for temporary caching at every boot-up? Does it have a high fault tolerance? <br/>
