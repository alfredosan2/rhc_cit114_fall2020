### 1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos 
+ The chapter went over the fundamentals of network security. It delved on concepts such as Cloud front, VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), and Route 53. It did mention that the concept of physical switches and networking too. Such as Wireless access points, Routers, L3 Switches, different topologies such as the most often used is star topology in most networks. It also delves into separating your network with subnetting so unnecessary devices are not roaming around your network and telephoning back home data.

### 2. Identify two quotes that were made, that you found interesting.
1. "The principle of least privilege is an important concept in computer security. It promotes that you grant only the minimal user privileges needed to the user, based on the needs of your users." (6.06). <br/>
2. The customer is responsible for what is implemented by using AWS services and for the applications that are connected to AWS. The security steps that you must take depend on the services that you use and the complexity of your system. Customer responsibilities include selecting and securing any instance operating systems, securing the applications that are launched on AWS resources, security group configurations, firewall configurations, network configurations, and secure account management. (6.04) <br/>

### 3. What new facts did you learn from this section?
+ How to implement AWS CloudFront and its nuances like working with Vpcs and elastic ip addresses was very interesting, and how you could do that on the fly.
+ Authorization is the process of determining what permissions a user, service or application should be granted. After a user has been authenticated, they must be authorized to access AWS services.

### 4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
1. There has to be more labs I can practice networking in the cloud with AWS, such creating security groups and such. <br/>
2. Is there anyways I can implement subnetting so I can divide up my network? Perhaps through subnetting? ( iot, wifi guests, main network for trusted devices) <br/>
