# Notes 2: Cloud Economics, Billing & Support

### 1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos 
+ Fundamentals of AWS pricing: The Compute – pay per processing cpu cycles, Storage – pay per Gb, Outbound data transfer – the more data you allow to be transferred outside of AWS data centers the more you pay. 
+ Free Tier: AWS will generously allow you to test drive certain services to familiarize or see if implementation is doable. It includes: Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFormation, VPC, Auto-Scaling, IAM, CloudFormation.
+ Traditional Infrastructure vs Cloud Infrastructure: In traditional set-ups data storage, equipment, and maintenance is done in-house. While in cloud set-ups you can use a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, Google, etc. to host your resources or you could also create and spin up your own private cloud by building it yourself.

### 2. Identify two quotes that were made, that you found interesting.
1. "System health monitoring: Monitor system-wide health, respond to performance changes, and optimize your resource utilization. With AWS CloudWatch (Links to an external site.), you get monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events, providing you with a unified view of your AWS resources, applications, and services that run on AWS and on-premises servers. " (2.16). <br/>
2. " Use free client software. Users can run most SaaS apps directly from their web browser without needing to download and install any software, although some apps require plugins. This means that you don’t need to purchase and install special software for your users." (2.12). <br/>

### 3. What new facts did you learn from this section?
1. Pay-as-you-go Using AWS does not mean you have to pay upfront a set monthly bill, you only have pay for what resources are consumed. <br/>
2. AWS Management Console: I thought I was going to have to memorize and learn various monitoring and locations of resources. But AWS has it all organized & in a human-friendly way to review and lots of templates. <br/>
3. What is the Total Cost of Ownership? TCO I didn’t know there was a formula that you could use to assess whether your existing infrastructure, existing skilled and humans, difference in cost pre-cloud and post-cloud. <br/>
4. Different support plans such as: Basic plan(free), developer, Business, Enterprise support plans each tuned to the need of that. <br/>

### 4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
1. In what ways could I implement AWS to save a medium business resources on contracting IT Support to maintain aging in-House Tech? Virtualize Wi-Fi-portal in the cloud? Create web based smart displays to showcase the update menu items or inventory? <br/>
