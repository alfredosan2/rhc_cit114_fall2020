#Notes 08: Databases
### 1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos  
+ I learned about Relational Databases; I didn’t know you could make data interact like that. Plus, the way you can view in different ways: like arranging data in a date field to be ordered according to a calendar system. Also how NoSQL databases are easier to scale than typical SQL ones since it uses horizontal scale-out: making it affordable and fast to run.

### 2. Identify two quotes that were made, that you found interesting.
1. "NoSQL is particularly useful for storing unstructured data, which is growing far more rapidly than structured data and does not fit the relational schemas of RDBMS. Common types of unstructured data include: user and session data; chat, messaging, and log data; time series data such as IoT and device data; and large objects such as video and images." (10.04). <br/>
2. "Managed services require the user to configure the service, however, much of the the underlying patching, backups, ensuring availability, and more are managed by the service provider. " (10.06). <br/>

### 3. What new facts did you learn from this section?
+ A combination of fields makes up a table. For example, each field in an employee table contains data about an individual employee.
+ A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain databases and control all access to them. The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide an environment that is both convenient and efficient for users to retrieve and store information.
+ A database system is referred to as self-describing because it not only contains the database itself, but also metadata which defines and describes the data and relationships between tables in the database.
+ Concurrency control strategies: features of a database that allow several users access to the same data item at the same time

### 4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
1. Maybe trying out designing a short and simple database to see how the data relationships interact a bit more? <br/>
2. I think practicing a bit more SQL would benefit me since I’m trying to target more the cyber-security aspect of databases and potentially point out data breaches in the future. <br/>
